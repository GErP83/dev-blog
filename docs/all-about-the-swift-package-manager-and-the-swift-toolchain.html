            <p>If you don't know too much about the Swift Package Manager, but you are looking for the basics please read my <a href="https://theswiftdev.com/2017/11/09/swift-package-manager-tutorial/">tutorial about SPM</a> that explains pretty much everything. The aim of this article is to go deep into the SPM architecture, also before you start reading this I'd recommend to also read my <a href="https://theswiftdev.com/2018/01/25/deep-dive-into-swift-frameworks/">article about frameworks and tools</a>. üìñ</p><p>Ready? Go! I mean Swift! üòÇ</p><h2>Swift Package Manager</h2><p>Have you ever wondered about <a href="http://bhargavg.com/swift/2016/06/11/how-swiftpm-parses-manifest-file.html" target="_blank">how does SPM parse it's manifest</a> file in order to <a href="http://log.zyxar.com/blog/2012/03/10/install-name-on-os-x/" target="_blank">install</a> your packages? Well, the Package.swift manifest is a strange beast. Let me show you an quick example of a regular package description file:</p><pre><code class="language-swift"><span class="comment">// swift-tools-version:4.2</span>
<span class="keyword">import</span> PackageDescription

<span class="keyword">let</span> package = <span class="type">Package</span>(
    name: <span class="string">"HelloSwift"</span>,
    dependencies: [
        <span class="comment">// .package(url: /* package url */, from: "1.0.0"),</span>
    ],
    targets: [
        .<span class="call">target</span>(
            name: <span class="string">"HelloSwift"</span>,
            dependencies: []),
        .<span class="call">testTarget</span>(
            name: <span class="string">"HelloSwiftTests"</span>,
            dependencies: [<span class="string">"HelloSwift"</span>]),
    ]
)</code></pre><p>The first line contains the version information, next we have to import the <code>PackageDescription</code> module which contains all the required elements to properly describe a Swift package. If you run for example <code>swift package update</code> all your dependencies in this manifest file will be resolved &amp; you can use them inside your own code files. ‚úÖ</p><blockquote><p>But how the heck are they doing this magic? üí´</p></blockquote><p>That question was bugging me for a while, so I did a little research. First I was trying to replicate this behavior without looking at the original implementation of the Swift Package Manager at <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. I knew I shouldn't parse the Swift file, because that'd be a horrible thing to do - Swift files are messy - so let's try to import it somehow... üôÉ</p><h2>Dynamic library loading approach</h2><p>I searched for the "dynamic swift library" keywords and found an interesting <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/communicating-with-dynamically-loaded-swift-library/6769" target="_blank">forum topic on swift.org</a>. Yeah, I'm making some progress I thought. WRONG! I was way further from the actual solution than I though, but it was fun, so I was looking into the implementation details of how to open a <a href="https://modocache.io/getting-started-with-swift-development" target="_blank">compiled</a> <code>.dylib</code> file using <code>dlopen</code> &amp; <code>dlsym</code> from Swift. How does one create a <code>.dylib</code> file? Ah, I already know this! üëç</p><p>I always wanted to understand this topic better, so I started to read more and more both about static and <a href="https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/it-looks-like-you-are-trying-to-use-a-framework/" target="_blank">dynamic libraries</a>. Long story short, you can create a dynamic (or static) library with the following product definition:</p><pre><code class="language-swift"><span class="comment">// swift-tools-version:4.2</span>
<span class="keyword">import</span> PackageDescription

<span class="keyword">let</span> package = <span class="type">Package</span>(
    name: <span class="string">"example"</span>,
    products: [
        .<span class="call">library</span>(name: <span class="string">"myStaticLib"</span>, type: .<span class="dotAccess">static</span>, targets: [<span class="string">"myStaticLib"</span>]),
        .<span class="call">library</span>(name: <span class="string">"myDynamicLib"</span>, type: .<span class="dotAccess">dynamic</span>, targets: [<span class="string">"myDynamicLib"</span>]),
    ],
    targets: [
        .<span class="call">target</span>(
            name: <span class="string">"myStaticLib"</span>,
            dependencies: []),
        .<span class="call">target</span>(
            name: <span class="string">"myDynamicLib"</span>,
            dependencies: []),
    ]
)</code></pre><p>The important files are going to be located inside the <code>.build/debug</code> folder. The <code>.swiftmodule</code> is basically the public header file, this contains all the available API for your library. The <code>.swiftdoc</code> file contains the documentation for the compiled <a href="https://railsware.com/blog/2014/06/26/creation-of-pure-swift-module/" target="_blank">module</a>, and depending on the type you'll also get a <code>.dylib</code> or a <code>.a</code> file. Guess which one is which.</p><p>So I could load the <code>.dylib</code> file by using <code>dlopen</code> &amp; dlsym (some <a href="https://theswiftdev.com/2018/03/29/everything-about-public-and-private-swift-attributes/">@_cdecl</a> magic involved to get constant names instead of the "fuzzy" ones), but I was constantly receiving the same <a href="https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-6091" target="_blank">warning</a> over and over again. The dynamic loading worked well, but I wanted to get rid of the warning, so I tried to remove the embedded the lib dependency from my executable target. (Hint: not really possible... afaik. anyone? üôÑ)</p><p>I was messing around with <a href="https://wincent.com/wiki/%40executable_path%2C_%40load_path_and_%40rpath" target="_blank">rpaths</a> &amp; the <code>install_name_tool</code> for like hours, but even after I succesfully removed my library from the executable, "libSwift*things" were still embedded into it. So that's the sad state of an unstable ABI, I thought... anyway at least I've learned something very important during the way here:</p><h2>Importing Swift code into Swift!</h2><p>Yes, you heard that. It's possible to import compiled Swift libraries into Swift, but not a lot of people heard about this (I assume). It's not a popular topic amongs iOS / UIKit developers, but SPM does this all the time behind the scenes. üòÖ</p><p>How the heck can we import the pre-built libraries? Well, it's pretty simple.</p><pre><code class="language-sh">// using swiftc with compiler flags

swiftc dynamic_main.swift -I ./.build/debug -lmyDynamicLib -L ./.build/debug
swiftc static_main.swift -I ./.build/debug -lmyStaticLib -L ./.build/debug

// using the Swift Package Manager with compiler flags

swift build -Xswiftc -I -Xswiftc ./.build/debug -Xswiftc -L -Xswiftc ./.build/debug -Xswiftc -lmyStaticLib
swift build -Xswiftc -I -Xswiftc ./.build/debug -Xswiftc -L -Xswiftc ./.build/debug -Xswiftc -lmyDynamicLib
</code></pre><p>You just have to append a few compiler flags. The <code>-I</code> stands for the import search path, <code>-L</code> is the library search path, <code>-l</code> links the given library. Check <code>swiftc -h</code> for more details and flags you won't regret it! Voil√° now you can distribute closed source Swift packages. At least it was good to know how SPM does the "trick". ü§ì</p><p class="warning">Please note that until Swift 5 &amp; ABI stability arrives you can use the precompiled libraries with the same Swift version only! So if you compile a lib with Swift 4.2, your executable also needs to be compiled with 4.2., but this will change pretty soon. üëè</p><p>The Swift Package Manager method</p><p>After 2 days of research &amp; learning I really wanted to solve this, so I've started to check the source code of SPM. The first thing I've tried was adding the <code>--verbose</code> flag after the <code>swift build</code> command. Here is the important thing:</p><pre><code class="language-sh">/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/swiftc \
--driver-mode=swift \
-L /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/lib/swift/pm/4_2 \
-lPackageDescription \
-suppress-warnings \
-swift-version 4.2 \
-I /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/lib/swift/pm/4_2 \
-target x86_64-apple-macosx10.10 \
-sdk /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.14.sdk \
/Users/tib/example/Package.swift \
-fileno 5
</code></pre><p>Whoa, this spits out a JSON based on my <code>Package.swift</code> file!!! üéâ</p><blockquote><p>How the hell are they doing this?</p></blockquote><p>It turns out, if you change the <code>-fileno</code> parameter value to 1 (that's the standard output) you can see the results of this command on the console. Now the trick here is that SPM simply compiles the Package.swift and if there is a <code>-fileno</code> flag present in the command line arguments, well it prints out the encoded JSON representation of the Package object after the process exits. That's it, fuckn' easy, but it took 1 more day for me to figure this out... parenting 2 kids &amp; coding is a hard combination. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p><p>If you open the <code>/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/</code> <code>Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/</code> <code>usr/lib/swift/pm/4_2</code> folder you'll see 3 familiar files there. Exactly. I also looked at the source of the <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/blob/master/Sources/PackageDescription4/Package.swift" target="_blank">Package.swift</a> file from the SPM repository, and followed the <code>registerExitHandler</code> method. After a successful <code>Package</code> initialization it simply registers an exit handler if a <code>-fileno</code> argument is present encodes itself &amp; dumps the result by using the file handler number. Sweet! üòé</p><p>Since I was pretty much in the finish lap, I wanted to figure out one more thing: how did they manage to put the <code>swift package</code> command under the <code>swift</code> command?</p><h2>Swift toolchain</h2><p>I just entered <code>swift lol</code> into my terminal. This is what happened:</p><pre><code>tib@~: swift lol
error: unable to invoke subcommand:
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/swift-lol
(No such file or directory)
</code></pre><p>Got ya! The <a href="https://blog.krzyzanowskim.com/2018/10/11/dealing-with-a-swift-toolchain/" target="_blank">toolchain</a> is the key to everything:</p><ol><li>Apple is compiling the PackageDescription library from the Swift Package Manager and puts the <code>.swiftmodule</code>, <code>.swiftdoc</code>, <code>.dylib</code> files into the proper places under Xcode's default toolchain library path.</li><li>The swift build, run, test subcommands are just another Swift binary executables placed inside the toolchain's binary path. (Named like: swift-package, swift-build, swift-run, swift-test)</li><li>The swift command tries to invoke the proper subcommand if there is any and it's a valid (Swift) binary. (Tried with a shell script, it failed miserably...)</li><li>SPM uses the PackageDescription library from the toolchain in order to compile &amp; turn the manifest file into JSON output.</li><li>The rest is history. ü§ê</li></ol><p class="note">Swift can resolve subcommands from anywhere "inside" the <code>PATH</code> variable. You just have to prefix your <a href="https://github.com/mxcl/swift-sh" target="_blank">Swift script</a> with <code>swift-</code> and you're good to go.</p><h2>SwiftCI - a task runner for Swift</h2><p>I had this idea that it'd be nice to have a <a href="https://gruntjs.com/" target="_blank">grunt</a> / <a href="https://gulpjs.com/" target="_blank">gulp</a> like task runner also a continuous integration service on a long term by using this technique I explained above. So I've made a similar extension wired into the heart of the Swift toolchain: <a href="https://github.com/BinaryBirds/CI" target="_blank">SwiftCI</a>. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p><p>You can grab the proof-of-concept implementation of SwiftCI from <a href="https://github.com/BinaryBirds/CI" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. After <a href="https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2009-11-06-linking-and-install-names.html" target="_blank">installing</a> it you can create your own <code>CI.swift</code> files and run your workflows.</p><pre><code class="language-swift"><span class="keyword">import</span> CI

<span class="keyword">let</span> buildWorkflow = <span class="type">Workflow</span>(
    name: <span class="string">"default"</span>,
    tasks: [
        <span class="type">Task</span>(name: <span class="string">"HelloWorld"</span>,
             url: <span class="string">"git@github.com:BinaryBirds/HelloWorld.git"</span>,
             version: <span class="string">"1.0.0"</span>,
             inputs: [:]),

        <span class="type">Task</span>(name: <span class="string">"OutputGenerator"</span>,
             url: <span class="string">"~/ci/Tasks/OutputGenerator"</span>,
             version: <span class="string">"1.0.0"</span>,
             inputs: [:]),

        <span class="type">Task</span>(name: <span class="string">"SampleTask"</span>,
             url: <span class="string">"git@github.com:BinaryBirds/SampleTask.git"</span>,
             version: <span class="string">"1.0.1"</span>,
             inputs: [<span class="string">"task-input-parameter"</span>: <span class="string">"Hello SampleTask!"</span>]),
    ])

<span class="keyword">let</span> testWorkflow = <span class="type">Workflow</span>(
    name: <span class="string">"linux"</span>,
    tasks: [
        <span class="type">Task</span>(name: <span class="string">"SampleTask"</span>,
             url: <span class="string">"https://github.com/BinaryBirds/SampleTask.git"</span>,
             version: <span class="string">"1.0.0"</span>,
             inputs: [<span class="string">"task-input-parameter"</span>: <span class="string">"Hello SampleTask!"</span>]),
        ])

<span class="keyword">let</span> project = <span class="type">Project</span>(name: <span class="string">"Example"</span>,
                      url: <span class="string">"git@github.com:BinaryBirds/Example.git"</span>,
                      workflows: [buildWorkflow, testWorkflow])</code></pre><p>The code above is a sample from a <code>CI.swift</code> file, you can simply run any workflow with the swift CI run workflow-name command. Everything is 100% written in Swift, even the CI workflow descriptor file. I'm planning to extend my CI namespace with some helpful sub-commands later on. PR's are more than welcomed!</p><p>I'm very happy with the result, not just because of the <a href="https://github.com/BinaryBirds/CI" target="_blank">final product</a> (that's only a proof of concept implementation), but mostly because of the things I've learned during the creation process.</p>
